//! i18n bridge for worker-side service messages.
//!
//! The Rust worker cannot call QML `qsTr`, so instead of building display text
//! it emits a structured token with a translation key and placeholder args
//! (see `markers.rs`, `SVC_OPEN` / `ERR_OPEN`). QML resolves the active
//! translation via `qsTr(key)` (`app.trSvc()`) and substitutes `%1`..`%9`.
//!
//! The keys below are the <source> strings of the .ts translation files
//! (kept language-neutral English). When a new key is added here it must also
//! be added to the .ts files, otherwise localized builds keep the English text.
